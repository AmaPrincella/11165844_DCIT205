              <h2>Our Mission</h2>
              <p>
                The College of Basic and Applied Sciences includes the computer
                science department. For those who wish to study computer science, we have programs available.
                Postgraduate and undergraduate courses are offered by the department. In computer science, undergraduate
                students can obtain a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree, while graduate students can pursue degrees in
                Master of Philosophy (MPhil) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). The department's primary goals are to teach
                and do research in a variety of computer science fields, including cybersecurity, artificial
                intelligence, programming, and algorithms. The instructors are experts in their disciplines with a
                wealth of information. They support students' learning and research endeavors. To help students with
                their studies, the department offers a library, computer labs, and other services.
                <br />
                We offer a world-class research facility combining theory with practical activities, and
                significantly advancing both the field and computing in the wider world. The Department sustains active
                research across the breadth of computer science and encourages the development of new technologies and
                applications.

            <h2>Key Information</h2>
            <p>
              Our programs are created to address the dearth of graduates with
              advanced degrees in the computer industry, which offers great job opportunities. The Department of
              Computer Science, which accepts students from all over the world, is fulfilling an important
              responsibility by producing computer science professionals qualified to meet the global needs for industry
              and research, while also keeping in mind that university departments have an obligation to develop skilled
              and competent professionals to face global challenges with new insights of problem-solving abilities. The
              department's goal of turning out capable and competent computer science professionals is being met thanks
              to the hard work and dedication of its highly qualified academic members.
